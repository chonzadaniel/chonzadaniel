# 👋 Hi, I'm Emmanuel Daniel Chonza

I'm a Data Scientist and Generative AI Practitioner passionate about building impactful solutions using NLP, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. My work explores how AI can solve real-world problems—from sentiment analysis to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## 🔭 Current work and Accomplishment:
- Fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs for custom NLP tasks
- Improving ML model fairness in imbalanced text classification
- Deploying real-time AI applications with Streamlit and Slack.
- Machine learning training using MLflow

## 🌱 In the pipeline:
- Vector databases for context-aware search (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB)
- Building production-ready GenAI apps and dashboards

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Applied NLP (especially underrepresented text domains), CV, ML, projects
- End-to-end MLOps/LLMOps pipelines
- AI/ML research with community impact

## 💡 Recent Featured Projects:
- A Multimodal RAG System with capabilities to retrieve different pdf contextual research papers from a locally persisted chromadb with a retrieval powered by `GPT-4o-min` LLM (openai).
- **Dog Breed Identifier** - This is an app with Stanford 120 dog breeds identification capabilities, by displaying the class name again the uploaded image. The app is currently locally running on streamlit.
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** - QLoRA, LoRA, IA3 binary classification on product sentiment analysis.
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection Classifier** - This project develops a robust machine learning pipeline for credit card fraud detection, leveraging a highly imbalanced dataset. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial for financial institutions to minimize monetary losses and protect customer assets.
- **Resume & Job Application Advisor** - An agentic system powered by CrewAI and open-source LLMs that helps job seekers improve their resumes, discover current job openings, generate tailored cover letters, and prepare for interviews — all in a single interactive Streamlit app.
- **Racist Tweet Classifier** — NLP pipeline with SymSpell correction, oversampling, stratified cross-validation & Streamlit UI  
- **Car Price Prediction** — Regression modeling using XGBoost and feature engineering on real marketplace data  
- **RAG Toolkit** — Experimenting with OpenAI, BGE, and LlamaIndex to build smarter retrieval pipelines
- **Image Classifier** - An End-to-End Image Classifier for 101 foodvision images capable of predicting the image label among the 101 foodvison image labels, e.g. sushi, pizza, etc. and a dog vision project in similar fashion using the 120 Stanford Dog breeds Image dataset
